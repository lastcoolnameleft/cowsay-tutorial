# Cowsay Tutorial

Cowsay is a great tool for getting animals to speak.  Like Mr. Ed, but with a cow instead.  And in text.  Use your imagination.

## Dead Cow

Use -m for your message and to have x for the eyes, run with -x.  For example:

```shell
cowsay -x -m You have died dysentery
```

Results:

```shell
