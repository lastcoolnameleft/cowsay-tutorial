## Setup

```shell
apt-get install cowsay
export PATH=/usr/games:$PATH
```

## Dead Cow

Use to have x for the eyes, run with -d.  For example:

```shell
cowsay -d You have died dysentery
```

Results:

```shell
 _________________________
< You have died dysentery >

        \   ^__^
         \  (xx)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
